$ASTER just wicked to $0.984 — and we bought every cent.

### The Bull Case (Data, Not Hope)
1. Funding still **+0.07%** → market structurally long
2. Open interest at all-time high **$0.52B**
3. Meteora TVL in AST pools up **380% in 30 days**
4. Aster now **#2 Solana DEX by volume**

We expect **$2.80–$3.20 by March 2026** → 3× from here with zero new tech required.

**Position:** Long spot, short perps, collecting 28% while we wait.

The dip is the gift.
